.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility mounts a
.Nm HAMMER
file system backed by
.Ar special
file(s) at mount point
.Ar node .
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl o Ar options
Options are specified with a
.Fl o
flag followed by a comma separated string of options.
See the
.Xr mount 8
man page for possible options and their meanings.
The following
.Nm HAMMER
specific options are also available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Cm nohistory
Put the entire file system in no-history mode.
Change history is not retained.
Use of this option may increase the overhead of doing mirroring.
This option is generally only used in an emergency.
.It Cm master= Ns Ar id
Assign a master id for the entire mount which applies to all PFSs under
the mount.
This is intended to help support multi-master and fail-over operation.
Multi-master operation is not yet supported.
If you intend
to upgrade slaves to masters and downgrade masters to slaves as part of
a fail-over setup, it's a good idea to assign a different master id
to the
.Nm HAMMER
mounts making up the fail-over group.
.It Cm nomirror
By default a
.Nm HAMMER
mount assigns a master id of 0.
You can force no-mirror operation by specifying this option.
This option disables
mirror transaction id propagation in the B-Tree and will improve write
performance somewhat but also prevents incremental mirroring from working
at all, and is not recommended.
.El
.It Fl T Ar transaction-id
Mount the file system as-of a particular
transaction id.
The mount will automatically be made read-only.
The
.Ar transaction-id
must be specified as a 64 bit hex value prefixed with "0x".
.It Fl u
Update the mount point.
This is typically used to upgrade a mount to
read-write or downgrade it to read-only.
.El
.Sh NOTES
Note that issuing a read-only mount which requires UNDOs to be run will
still run the UNDOs, but will not flush the buffer cache buffers until/if
the mount is updated to read-write.
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std
.Sh EXAMPLES
Mount a
.Nm HAMMER
file system made up of two volumes onto
.Pa /mnt :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
mount_hammer -o ro,noatime /dev/ad0s1d /dev/ad1s1d /mnt
.Ed
.Pp
Above is equivalent to below using blkdevs format for
.Nm HAMMER
volumes as
.Nm
supports both formats.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
mount_hammer -o ro,noatime /dev/ad0s1d:/dev/ad1s1d /mnt
.Ed
.Pp
A corresponding
.Xr fstab 5
entry is:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
/dev/ad0s1d:/dev/ad1s1d /mnt hammer ro,noatime
.Ed
