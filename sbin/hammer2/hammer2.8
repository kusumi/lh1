.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility provides miscellaneous support functions for a
HAMMER2 file system.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl s Ar path
Specify the path to a mounted HAMMER2 filesystem.
At least one PFS on a HAMMER2 filesystem must be mounted for the system
to act on all PFSs managed by it.
Every HAMMER2 filesystem typically has a PFS called "LOCAL" for this purpose.
.It Fl t Ar type
Specify the type when creating, upgrading, or downgrading a PFS.
Supported types are MASTER, SLAVE, SOFT_MASTER, SOFT_SLAVE, CACHE, and DUMMY.
If not specified the pfs-create directive will default to MASTER if no
uuid is specified, and SLAVE if a uuid is specified.
.It Fl u Ar uuid
Specify the cluster uuid when creating a PFS.  If not specified, a unique,
random uuid will be generated.
Note that every PFS also has a unique pfs_id which is always generated
and cannot be overridden with an option.
The { pfs_clid, pfs_fsid } tuple uniquely identifies a component of a cluster.
.It Fl m Ar mem
Specify how much tracking memory to use for certain directives.
At the moment, this option is only applicable to the
.Cm bulkfree
directive, allowing it to operate in fewer passes when given more memory.
A nominal value for a 4TB drive with a ton of stuff on it would be around
a gigabyte '-m 1g'.
.El
.Pp
.Nm
directives are as shown below.
Note that most directives require you to either be CD'd into a hammer2
filesystem, specify a path to a mounted hammer2 filesystem via the
.Fl s
option, or specify a path after the directive.
It depends on the directive.
All hammer2 filesystem have a PFS called "LOCAL" which is typically mounted
locally on the host in order to be able to issue commands for other PFSs
on the filesystem.
The mount also enables PFS configuration scanning for that filesystem.
.Bl -tag -width indent
.\" ==== cleanup ====
.It Cm cleanup Op path
Perform manual cleanup passes on paths or all mounted partitions.
.\" ==== connect ====
.It Cm connect Ar target
Add a cluster link entry to the volume header.
The volume header can support up to 255 link entries.
This feature is not currently used.
.\" ==== destroy ====
.It Cm destroy Ar path...
Destroy the specified directory entry in a hammer2 filesystem.  This bypasses
all normal checks and will unconditionally destroy the directory entry.
The underlying inode is not checked and, if it does exist, its nlinks count
is not decremented.
This directive should only be used to destroy a corrupted directory entry
which no longer has a working inode.
.Pp
Note that this command may desynchronize the system namecache for the
specified entry.  If this happens, you may have to unmount and remount the
filesystem.
.\" ==== destroy-inum ====
.It Cm destroy-inum Ar path...
Destroy the specified inode in a hammer2 filesystem.
.\" ==== disconnect ====
.It Cm disconnect Ar target
Delete a cluster link entry from the volume header.
This feature is not currently used.
.\" ==== info ====
.It Cm info Op devpath...
Access and print the status and super-root entries for all HAMMER2
partitions found in /dev/serno or the specified device path(s).
The partitions do not have to be mounted.
Note that only mounted partitions will be under active management.
This is accomplished by mounting at least one PFS within the partition.
Typically at least the @LOCAL PFS is mounted.
.\" ==== mountall ====
.It Cm mountall Op devpath...
This directive mounts the @LOCAL PFS on all HAMMER2 partitions found
in /dev/serno, or the specified device path(s).
The partitions are mounted as /var/hammer2/LOCAL.<id>.
Mounts are executed in the background and this command will wait a
limited amount of time for the mounts to complete before returning.
.\" ==== status ====
.It Cm status Op path...
Dump a list of all cluster link entries configured in the volume header.
.\" ==== hash ====
.It Cm hash Op filename...
Compute and print the directory hash for any number of filenames.
.\" ==== dhash ====
.It Cm dhash Op filename...
Compute and print the data hash for long directory entry for any number of filenames.
.\" ==== pfs-list ====
.It Cm pfs-list Op path...
List all local PFSs available on a mounted HAMMER2 filesystem, their type,
and their current status.
You must mount at least one PFS in order to be able to access the whole list.
.\" ==== pfs-clid ====
.It Cm pfs-clid Ar label
Print the cluster id for a PFS specified by name.
.\" ==== pfs-fsid ====
.It Cm pfs-fsid Ar label
Print the unique filesystem id for a PFS specified by name.
.\" ==== pfs-create ====
.It Cm pfs-create Ar label
Create a local PFS on a mounted HAMMER2 filesystem.
If no uuid is specified the pfs-type defaults to MASTER.
If a uuid is specified via the
.Fl u
option the pfs-type defaults to SLAVE.
Other types can be specified with the
.Fl t
option.
.Pp
If you wish to add a MASTER to an existing cluster, you must first add it as
a SLAVE and then upgrade it to MASTER to properly synchronize it.
.Pp
The DUMMY pfs-type is used to tie network-accessible clusters into the local
machine when no local storage is desired.
This type should be used on minimal H2 partitions or entirely in ram for
netboot-centric systems to provide a tie-in point for the mount command,
or on more complex systems where you need to also access network-centric
clusters.
.Pp
The CACHE or SLAVE pfs-type is typically used when the main store is on
the network but local storage is desired to improve performance.
SLAVE is also used when a backup is desired.
.Pp
Generally speaking, you can mount any PFS element of a cluster in order to
access the cluster via the full cluster protocol.
There are two exceptions.
If you mount a SOFT_SLAVE or a SOFT_MASTER then soft quorum semantics are
employed... the soft slave or soft master's current state will always be used
and the quorum protocol will not be used.  The soft PFS will still be
synchronized to masters in the background when available.
Also, you can use
.Sq mount -o local
to mount ONLY a local HAMMER2 PFS and
not run any network or quorum protocols for the mount.
All such mounts except for a SOFT_MASTER mount will be read-only.
Other than that, you will be mounting the whole cluster when you mount any
PFS within the cluster.
.Pp
DUMMY - Create a PFS skeleton intended to be the mount point for a
more complex cluster, probably one that is entirely network based.
No data will be synchronized to this PFS so it is suitable for use
in a network boot image or memory filesystem.
This allows you to create placeholders for mount points on your local
disk, SSD, or memory disk.
.Pp
CACHE - Create a PFS for caching portions of the cluster piecemeal.
This is similar to a SLAVE but does not synchronize the entire contents of
the cluster to the PFS.
Elements found in the CACHE PFS which are validated against the cluster
will be read, presumably a faster access than having to go to the cluster.
Only local CACHEs will be updated.
Network-accessible CACHE PFSs might be read but will not be written to.
If you have a large hard-drive-based cluster you can set up localized
SSD CACHE PFSs to improve performance.
.Pp
SLAVE - Create a PFS which maintains synchronization with and provides a
read-only copy of the cluster.
HAMMER2 will prioritize local SLAVEs for data retrieval after validating
their transaction id against the cluster.
The difference between a CACHE and a SLAVE is that the SLAVE is synchronized
to a full copy of the cluster and thus can serve as a backup or be staged
for use as a MASTER later on.
.Pp
SOFT_SLAVE - Create a PFS which maintains synchronization with and provides
a read-only copy of the cluster.
This is one of the special mount cases.  A SOFT_SLAVE will synchronize with
the cluster when the cluster is available, but can still be accessed when
the cluster is not available.
.Pp
MASTER - Create a PFS which will hold a master copy of the cluster.
If you create several MASTER PFSs with the same cluster id you are
effectively creating a multi-master cluster and causing a quorum and
cache coherency protocol to be used to validate operations.
The total number of masters is stored in each PFSs making up the cluster.
Filesystem operations will stall for normal mounts if a quorum cannot be
obtained to validate the operation.
MASTER nodes which go offline and return later will synchronize in the
background.
Note that when adding a MASTER to an existing cluster you must add the
new PFS as a SLAVE and then upgrade it to a MASTER.
.Pp
SOFT_MASTER - Create a PFS which maintains synchronization with and provides
a read-write copy of the cluster.
This is one of the special mount cases.  A SOFT_MASTER will synchronize with
the cluster when the cluster is available, but can still be read AND written
to even when the cluster is not available.
Modifications made to a SOFT_MASTER will be automatically flushed to the
cluster when it becomes accessible again, and vise-versa.
Manual intervention may be required if a conflict occurs during
synchronization.
.\" ==== pfs-delete ====
.It Cm pfs-delete Ar label
Delete a local PFS on a mounted HAMMER2 filesystem.
Deleting a PFS of type MASTER requires first downgrading it to a SLAVE (XXX).
.\" ==== snapshot ====
.It Cm snapshot Ar path Op label
Create a snapshot of a directory.
This can only be used on a local PFS, and is only really useful if the PFS
contains a complete copy of what you desire to snapshot so that typically
means a local MASTER, SOFT_MASTER, SLAVE, or SOFT_SLAVE must be present.
Snapshots are created simply by flushing a PFS mount to disk and then copying
the directory inode to the PFS.
The topology is snapshotted without having to be copied or scanned.
Snapshots are effectively separate from the cluster they came from
and can be used as a starting point for a new cluster.
So unless you build a new cluster from the snapshot, it will stay local
to the machine it was made on.
.\" ==== snapshot-debug ====
.It Cm snapshot-debug Ar path Op label
Snapshot without filesystem sync.
.\" ==== service ====
.It Cm service
Start the
.Nm
service daemon.
This daemon is also automatically started when you run
.Xr mount_hammer2 8 .
The hammer2 service daemon handles incoming TCP connections and maintains
outgoing TCP connections.  It will interconnect available services on the
machine (e.g. hammer2 mounts and xdisks) to the network.
.\" ==== stat ====
.It Cm stat Op path...
Print the inode statistics, compression, and other meta-data associated
with a list of paths.
.\" ==== leaf ====
.It Cm leaf
XXX
.\" ==== shell ====
.It Cm shell Op host
Start a debug shell to the local hammer2 service daemon via the DMSG protocol.
.\" ==== debugspan ====
.It Cm debugspan Ar target
(do not use)
.\" ==== rsainit ====
.It Cm rsainit Op path
Create the
.Pa /etc/hammer2
directory and initialize a public/private keypair in that directory for
use by the network cluster protocols.
.\" ==== show ====
.It Cm show Ar devpath
Dump the radix tree for the HAMMER2 filesystem by scanning a
block device directly.  No mount is required.
.\" ==== freemap ====
.It Cm freemap Ar devpath
Dump the freemap tree for the HAMMER2 filesystem by scanning a
block device directly.  No mount is required.
.\" ==== setcomp ====
.It Cm setcomp Ar mode[:level] Ar path...
Set the compression mode as specified for any newly created elements at or
under the path if not overridden by deeper elements.
Available modes are none, autozero, lz4, or zlib.
When zlib is used the compression level can be set.
The default will be 6 which is the best trade-off between performance and
time.
.Pp
newfs_hammer2 will set the default compression to lz4 which prioritizes
speed over performance.
Also note that HAMMER2 contains a heuristic and will not attempt to
compress every block if it detects a sufficient amount of uncompressable
data.
.Pp
Hammer2 compression is only effective when it can reduce the size of dataset
(typically a 64KB block) by one or more powers of 2.  A 64K block which
only compresses to 40K will not yield any storage improvement.
.Pp
Generally speaking you do not want to set the compression mode to
.Sq none ,
as this will cause blocks of all-zeros to be written as all-zero blocks,
instead of holes.  The
.Sq autozero
compression mode detects blocks of all-zeros
and writes them as holes.  However, HAMMER2 will rewrite data in-place if
the compression mode is set to
.Sq none
and the check code is set to
.Sq  disabled .
Formal snapshots will still snapshot such files.  However,
de-duplication will no longer function on the data blocks.
.\" ==== setcheck ====
.It Cm setcheck Ar check Ar path...
Set the check code as specified for any newly created elements at or under
the path if not overridden by deeper elements.
Available codes are default, disabled, crc32, xxhash64, or sha192.
.\" ==== clrcheck ====
.It Cm clrcheck Op path...
Clear the check code override for the specified paths.
Overrides may still be present in deeper elements.
.\" ==== setcrc32 ====
.It Cm setcrc32 Op path...
Set the check code to the ISCSI 32-bit CRC for any newly created elements
at or under the path if not overridden by deeper elements.
.\" ==== setxxhash64 ====
.It Cm setxxhash64 Op path...
Set the check code to XXHASH64, a fast 64-bit hash
.\" ==== setsha192 ====
.It Cm setsha192 Op path...
Set the check code to SHA192 for any newly created elements at or under
the path if not overridden by deeper elements.
.\" ==== bulkfree ====
.It Cm bulkfree Ar path
Run a bulkfree pass on a HAMMER2 mount.
You can specify any PFS for the mount, the bulkfree pass is run on the
entire partition.
Note that it takes two passes to actually free space.
By default this directive will use up to 1/16 physical memory to track
the freemap.  The amount of memory used may be overridden with the
.Op Fl m Ar mem
option.
.\" ==== printinode ====
.It Cm printinode Ar path
Dump inode.
.\" ==== dumpchain ====
.It Cm dumpchain Op path Op chnflags
Dump in-memory chain topology.
.El
.Sh SYSCTLS
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Va vfs.hammer2.dedup_enable (default on)
Enables live de-duplication.  Any recently read data that is on-media
(already synchronized to media) is tested against pending writes for
compatibility.  If a match is found, the write will reference the
existing on-media data instead of writing new data.
.It Va vfs.hammer2.always_compress (default off)
This disables the H2 compression heuristic and forces H2 to always
try to compress data blocks, even if they look uncompressable.
Enabling this option reduces performance but has higher de-duplication
repeatability.
.It Va vfs.hammer2.cluster_data_read (default 4)
.It Va vfs.hammer2.cluster_meta_read (default 1)
Set the amount of read-ahead clustering to perform on data and meta-data
blocks.
.It Va vfs.hammer2.cluster_write (default 4)
Set the amount of write-behind clustering to perform in buffers.  Each
buffer represents 64KB.  The default is 4 and higher values typically do
not improve performance.  A value of 0 disables clustered writes.
This variable applies to the underlying media device, not to logical
file writes, so it should not interfere with temporary file optimization.
Generally speaking you want this enabled to generate smoothly pipelined
writes to the media.
.It Va vfs.hammer2.bulkfree_tps (default 5000)
Set bulkfree's maximum scan rate.  This is primarily intended to limit
I/O utilization on SSDs and cpu utilization when the meta-data is mostly
cached in memory.
.El
.Sh SETTING UP /etc/hammer2
The
.Sq rsainit
directive will create the
.Pa /etc/hammer2
directory with appropriate permissions and also generate a public key
pair in this directory for the machine.  These files will be
.Pa rsa.pub
and
.Pa rsa.prv
and needless to say, the private key shouldn't leave the host.
.Pp
The service daemon will also scan the
.Pa /etc/hammer2/autoconn
file which contains a list of hosts which it will automatically maintain
connections to to form your cluster.
The service daemon will automatically reconnect on any failure and will
also monitor the file for changes.
.Pp
When the service daemon receives a connection it expects to find a
public key for that connection in a file in
.Pa /etc/hammer2/remote/
called
.Pa <IPADDR>.pub .
You normally copy the
.Pa rsa.pub
key from the host in question to this file.
The IP address must match exactly or the connection will not be allowed.
.Pp
If you want to use an unencrypted connection you can create empty,
dummy files in the remote directory in the form
.Pa <IPADDR>.none .
We do not recommend using unencrypted connections.
.Sh CLUSTER SERVICES
Currently there are two services which use the cluster network infrastructure,
HAMMER2 mounts and XDISK.
Any HAMMER2 mount will make all PFSs for that filesystem available to the
cluster.
And if the XDISK kernel module is loaded, the hammer2 service daemon will make
your machine's block devices available to the cluster (you must load the
xdisk.ko kernel module before starting the hammer2 service).
They will show up as
.Pa /dev/xa*
and
.Pa /dev/serno/*
devices on the remote machines making up the cluster.
Remote block devices are just what they appear to be... direct access to a
block device on a remote machine.  If the link goes down remote accesses
will stall until it comes back up again, then automatically requeue any
pending I/O and resume as if nothing happened.
However, if the server hosting the physical disks crashes or is rebooted,
any remote opens to its devices will see a permanent I/O failure requiring a
close and open sequence to re-establish.
The latter is necessary because the server's drives might not have committed
the data before the crash, but had already acknowledged the transfer.
.Pp
Data commits work exactly the same as they do for real block devices.
The originater must issue a BUF_CMD_FLUSH.
.Sh ADDING A NEW MASTER TO A CLUSTER
When you
.Xr newfs_hammer2 8
a HAMMER2 filesystem or use the
.Sq pfs-create
directive on one already mounted
to create a new PFS, with no special options, you wind up with a PFS
typed as a MASTER and a unique cluster uuid, but because there is only one
PFS for that cluster (for each PFS you create via pfs-create), it will
act just like a normal filesystem would act and does not require any special
protocols to operate.
.Pp
If you use the
.Sq pfs-create
directive along with the
.Fl u
option to specify a cluster uuid that already exists in the cluster,
you are adding a PFS to an existing cluster and this can trigger a whole
series of events in the background.
When you specify the
.Fl u
option in a
.Sq pfs-create ,
.Nm
will by default create a SLAVE PFS.
In fact, this is what must be created first even if you want to add a new
MASTER to your cluster.
.Pp
The most common action a system admin will want to take is to upgrade or
downgrade a PFS.
A new MASTER can be added to the cluster by upgrading an existing SLAVE
to MASTER.
A MASTER can be removed from the cluster by downgrading it to a SLAVE.
Upgrades and downgrades will put nodes in the cluster in a transition state
until the operation is complete.
For downgrades the transition state is fleeting unless one or more other
masters has not acknowledged the change.
For upgrades a background synchronization process must complete before the
transition can be said to be complete, and the node remains (really) a SLAVE
until that transition is complete.
.Sh USE CASES FOR A SOFT_MASTER
The SOFT_MASTER PFS type is a special type which must be specifically
mounted by a machine.
It is a R/W mount which does not use the quorum protocol and is not
cache coherent with the cluster, but which synchronizes from the cluster
and allows modifying operations which will synchronize to the cluster.
The most common case is to use a SOFT_MASTER PFS in a laptop allowing you
to work on your laptop when you are on the road and not connected to
your main servers, and for the laptop to synchronize when a connection is
available.
.Sh USE CASES FOR A SOFT_SLAVE
A SOFT_SLAVE PFS type is a special type which must be specifically mounted
by a machine.
It is a RO mount which does not use the quorum protocol and is not
cache coherent with the cluster.  It will receive synchronization from
the cluster when network connectivity is available but will not stall if
network connectivity is lost.
.Sh FSYNC FLUSH MODES
TODO.
.Sh RESTORING FROM A SNAPSHOT BACKUP
TODO.
.Sh PERFORMANCE TUNING
Because HAMMER2 implements compression, decompression, and dedup natively,
it always double-buffers file data.  This means that the file data is
cached via the device vnode (in compressed / dedupped-form) and the same
data is also cached by the file vnode (in decompressed / non-dedupped form).
.Pp
While HAMMER2 will try to age the logical file buffers on its, some
additional performance tuning may be necessary for optimal operation
whether swapcache is used or not.  Our recommendation is to reduce the
number of vnodes (and thus also the logical buffer cache behind the
vnodes) that the system caches via the
.Va kern.maxvnodes
sysctl.
.Pp
Too-large a value will result in excessive double-caching and can cause
unnecessary read disk I/O.
We recommend a number between 25000 and 250000 vnodes, depending on your
use case.
Keep in mind that even though the vnode cache is smaller, this will make
room for a great deal more device-level buffer caching which can encompasses
far more data and meta-data than the vnode-level caching.
