The

.Ar special
file at mount point
.Ar node .
PFS

is mounted.
.Pp
.Cm @ Ns Ar label
(no
.Ar special )
is a short form, which mounts
.Ar label
from an already mounted
.Nm HAMMER2
filesystem.
If there are multiple mounts with the same
.Ar label ,
the first one mounted takes precedence over others.
.Pp
Default value for
.Ar label
is based on partition of
.Ar special :
.Ql a
defaults to "BOOT" ,
.Ql d
defaults to "ROOT",
and any other partition defaults to "DATA".
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl o Ar options
Options are specified with a
.Fl o
flag followed by a comma separated string of options.
See the
.Xr mount 8

.Nm HAMMER2
specific options are also available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
